Description: light-weight argument validator
 Ridiculously light-weight argument validator with Node.js that is an
 event-based server-side JavaScript engine
 .
 This JavaScript engine can help you to do argument validation in
 easy manner. It is easier and concise to use than that of assertions.
 The types are specified by a single character and there is nothing
 like optional argument.
